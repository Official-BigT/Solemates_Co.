🟢 Design Choices for SoleMates – Unisex Shoe Store
🖼️ 1. Visual Identity & Branding

Chose the name SoleMates to reflect a trendy, approachable shoe brand.

Used a clean, bold font (Ribeye) for personality and uniqueness.

Added a store icon from Boxicons to enhance brand imagery.

🎨 2. Color Scheme

A cyan-blue palette (bg-cyan-400, bg-cyan-600) was chosen to represent freshness and energy.

Balanced with white and dark tones for contrast and readability.

📐3.  Layout Structure

Followed a clean, three-section layout: Header, Product Grid, Footer.

Used Tailwind CSS to apply a responsive grid system that adapts from mobile to large screens without extra CSS.

🧱 4. Component Design

Product cards are modular and reusable, each with an image, title, description, and button.

Used utility-first classes in Tailwind for fast, consistent styling across elements.

📱5.  Mobile-First & Responsive

Built with mobile-first approach, then scaled up using Tailwind's responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:).

Ensured text resizing, grid reflow, and spacing adapt fluidly on all viewports.

📤6. CTA & Navigation

Navigation is minimal and clear, linking to core sections: Shop, About, Contact.

Buttons are clearly styled with hover effects to encourage interaction and guide users toward action.
